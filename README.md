VideoSync
=========

This VideoSync web application automatically synchronizes and combines personal and crowd-sourced YouTube video clips to recreate a live concert experience from multiple angles.

### Align Audio
##### (alignment.py)
Video alignment is determined by applying signal processing methods to the audio portion of the file and uses time-frequency constellation analysis to determine when the songs overlap.

### Web Application
##### (app.py)
The web application is set up using python's Flask framework. Users are able to view previously aligned videos and synchronize new ones. New videos can be uploaded by users or linked from YouTube.

### Database
##### (model.py & tracks.db)
The SQLite database is used to store a library of information about previously analyzed and synchronized videos, including track title, artist, live event, the delay between videos, and YouTube link details. The database model is set up and maintained using SQLAlchemy.

### User Interface
##### (index.html, watch.html, videoSync.js)
The front end utilizes HTML5, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and the YouTube Player API. These files are stored in the templates folder.

### How VideoSync Works
![Alt text](screenshots/diagram.png "Explanation diagram")
* **YouTube Link:** Download YouTube videos as MP4 files with **youtube-dl** command line program.
* **WAV File:** Strip audio from video file using the **avconv** audio/video converter. Read audio data using the Python **scipy** library.
* **Fourier Transform of Audio Signal:** Split audio into bins and apply the Fourier transform on each bin using the **numpy** library. The Fourier transform converts each bin data from the time domain to the frequency domain.
* **Peak Frequencies:** Identify the frequency with the highest intensity in each bin to create a peak frequency constellation.
* **Frequency Constellation Alignment:** Determine time offset by aligning frequency constellations of the two audio files. 

## Installation

Use Python 3.5+, and have ffmpeg and GSL headers installed:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
# The following one needs some reqs at build time, that's why it goes after:
pip install git+https://github.com/sauliusl/mlpy@dd7f5ce
```

## Run

```bash
export FLASK_APP=video_sync
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```
